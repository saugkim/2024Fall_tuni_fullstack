## Lecture #1: HTML and DOM

Lecture 1 Material - reading material, videos, code samples, interactive samples

The first chapter of the course material starts with the absolute basics - what is HTML and how to write it. Check out the material, do the assignments and fill in the MCQ about the lecture topic. Remember, that the lecture material has tons of links to extra material and sometimes the lecture MCQ'a refer to some of these. You may search for the answers while filling the MCQ.

Also in the future, the numbers and content of the material's chapters are connected to the exercise rounds. But hey, no-one is stopping you from reading through the material earlier. :-)

Books on topic
The following online books are available from Tampere University library. It is recommended that you at least look through each of them. You know, YouTube videos are nice and easy, but can lack depth of analysis of topic. These books provide a deeper understanding. Note also, that books cannot keep up with all of the latest software versions and some times changes are introduced, but the fundamentals are pretty constant.
