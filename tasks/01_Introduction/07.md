## Semantic HTML and metadata

**Exercise Instructions**

**Exercise Overview**  
This exercise involves enhancing a simple webpage with semantic HTML elements.

**Solving the exercise**  
You can find the exercise in the repository's directory exercises/01_html/ex7. So, start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its exercises/01_html/ex7 directory. Complete the following tasks:

1. Assign a title to the document using the appropriate tag within the \<head\> section.

2. Add Open Graph \<meta\> tags within the <head> section, including:
  - title
  - description
  - image
You can use any valid values for these properties.

3. Replace \<div\> tags within the \<body\> section with suitable semantic HTML elements.

Within the \<body\> section, only update the \<div\> tags. Do NOT alter any other content.

After applying the appropriate tags, the webpage should resemble the following screenshot:
