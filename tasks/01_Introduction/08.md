## HTML tables

**Exercise instructions**

**Exercise Overview**  
In this exercise, you will create a HTML table to display student scores data, including adding header cells and merging cells.

**Solving the exercise**  
You can find the exercise in the repository's directory exercises/01_html/ex8. So, start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its exercises/01_html/ex8 directory. The table should satisfy the following criteria:

  - There are two header cells Name and Score
  - The name and score for each student are, respectively:
    - John Doe: 85, 90
    - Sam Brown: 78
    - Lisa While: 92
  - John Doe should span 2 rows to cover both scores. Otherwise, each student's name and score should be in a separate cell.
  - One additional row Total students: 3 is added at the end of the table. The row should span 2 columns.
Link the styles.css CSS stylesheet to the index.html by adding the line \<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"\> inside the head element

Now modify the code inside \<table\> element. After applying the appropriate tags, the webpage should resemble the following screenshot:
