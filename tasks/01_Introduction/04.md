## Exercises pulled from course-upstream

### Setting course-upstream

**Add course-upstream to git remotes**  
You now have a personal git repository that is located over at course-gitlab.tuni.fi.
Your git repository only includes files that were present in the repository when you got it and the files you might have added to it.
In order to get updates, new files, and modifications from the course's teacher's repository, you have to add the teacher's repository as a remote to your personal git repository. This way, you can pull from the remote and get the changes in your repo.

The address of the teacher's repository: git@course-gitlab.tuni.fi:intro-2-full-stack-fall2024/course-upstream.git
From this point on, let's call it course-upstream. So course-upstream is the repository where teacher puts updates to, and from which students pull updates to their own repositories.

After you have successfully cloned your own repository to your own computer and completed the exercises before this one, you can add the course-upstream to your local remotes like so:
```      
git remote add course-upstream git@course-gitlab.tuni.fi:intro-2-full-stack-fall2024/course-upstream.git
```
After adding the remote you can view your remotes by
```
git remote -v
```

and you can pull from the course-upstream by
```
git pull course-upstream main
```
That tells git to pull latest changes from the course-upstream remote and merge them into your local main branch. It will ask you to make a merge commit message. You most likely should not change it in any way from the default message.  
In case, the merge does not succeed because of the error message:

fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
add the option:
```
git pull course-upstream main  --allow-unrelated-histories
```
Potential merge conflicts are to be solved manually.

Beware that
```
git pull
```
will still pull from your own repository at course-gitlab.tuni.fi, it will not pull from the course-upstream.

The workflow will now be:

  - The teacher adds material (exercise stuff, lecture slides etc.) to the course-upstream
  - The students get notified of the updates
  - The students pull from the course-upstream so that their repositories are updated to contain latest stuff
