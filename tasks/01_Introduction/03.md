## Hello git

### Hello Git!

This exercise is meant as a gentle introduction to the Git workflow used during this course. You will learn how to clone your Git project to a computer, edit a file, add those edits, commit your changes and finally push them to your repository at GitLab.

**Solving the exercise**  

1. Installing Git  
In addition to the remote GitLab repository that you discovered in the last exercise, you need to install the Git program to clone the remote repository as your local working copy, and to push your local changes into remote repository and to pull changes from the remote.

Many modern Linux systems have Git installed by default. You can search for "terminal" program in your system and test your installation by typing git. If you do not have git already installed on your computer, where you intend to work, you can download git for various platforms from the official site: http://git-scm.com/downloads.

On Windows, the rest of the course instructions expect you are using Git Bash -terminal from the git installation instead of the default Windows command prompt. On high resolution screens you probably want to make the Git Bash font bigger. Click at the top left corner to open the window menu. Adjust font size in properties.

On OS X, calling git in terminal may present a dialog to install command line developer tools. This is a good option and will play well with any Apple tools in future. If you want the latest Git version you can download installation package from git-scm.com. However, Os X will refuse to install it when clicking. You can install the package from unidentified developer via holding Ctrl-key and clicking package to select "Open" in context menu.

Many IDE or versioning programs support Git and you may use them on this course, but without support from course personnel. We encourage you to learn Git by using command line which you can use in all environments and over remote connections. General help using a bash type command line can be found for example here http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/ and you can receive help at the exercise sessions.


2. Generate and set a SSH key  
To enable cloning your project to your local computer you need to add an SSH key to your GitLab profile. The following commands typed in to a terminal will create a new key pair and display the public key. (If you already have a key you are using somewhere else, you can use the existing one.)
```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
# ... you will receive a series of questions ...
# Type [ENTER] to accept each default, really no changes unless you know why.
$ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
# ... the public key encoded as characters prints out ...
# In Git Bash use window menu: edit > mark to copy the key to clipboard.
```

The public key is entered to your GitLab profile via "Add an SSH Key". The title of the key is only for your own information.


3. Cloning a project  
Remember: during this course ALWAYS use the string from the "Clone with SSH" field in GitLab when cloning the repositories, or submitting exercises to Plussa.

Now you are ready to clone your project on your local machine. You can copy your repository SSH address from the top of your repository home page. Choose a directory and type:
```
$ git clone git@course-gitlab.tuni.fi:intro-2-full-stack-fall2024/YOUR_USERNAME.git intro-2-full-stack-fall2024

Cloning into 'intro-2-full-stack-fall2024'...
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
...
```
This will authenticate you on the server with the SSH key you created in the previous step and create a folder with the name of intro-2-full-stack-fall2024 where the contents of your repository from your server are cloned. If you did not change directories in Git Bash look for C:\Users\<username>\intro-2-full-stack-fall2024 on your computer.

For the next steps in the instructions change directory to intro-2-full-stack-fall2024. Following example shows how to change to the directory with cd, and how to list the contents of your cloned working copy with ls.
```
$ cd intro-2-full-stack-fall2024
$ ls
exercises/   README.md   Vagrantfile   vagrant/
```

IMPORTANT! Actually read the README.md, from start to end. It has important information about setting up the tools for this course. You can read it for example in GitLab which displays Markdown files beautifully.

Note that GitLab also has a feature where you can download your project. CLONE YOUR PROJECT, DO NOT JUST DOWNLOAD IT! If you download your project instead of cloning you will NOT be able to submit your exercises.

4. Editing the index.html file  
Open up exercises/01_html/ex3/index.html on your favorite code editor. If you have no preferences VS Code is a good choice that we support and recommend, because the editor is pre-installed in Exam classes as well.

You are free to edit the index.html file to test things out, it just needs to match following four criteria so you get the points from this exercise:

  - index.html must be valid html5. You can use for example the W3C Validation Service to check your file.
  - content attribute of the meta element with the name attribute author must be changed
  - Content of em element with the id attribute sig must be changed
  - The contents of the changed attribute and element listed above must be the same
  - content attribute of the meta element with the name attribute keywords must be changed to be exactly the string "HTML5".

5. Add, Commit and Push changes  
On windows, git will most likely complain about your user identity when you try to commit your changes. You should start this step by explaining who you are.
```
$ git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
$ git config --global user.email first.last@tuni.fi
```
After you've modified the index.html file, you need to commit your modifications. First check the status of the project:
```
$ git status

On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

  modified:   exercises/01_html/ex3/index.html

  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

To stage files for a commit you first need to add them. Note that add does not refer to adding a new file to your project but adding a file to a commit.
```
$ git add exercises/01_html/ex3/index.html
```
Again you can check with git status that the file will be included in the commit:
```
$ git status

On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

  modified:   exercises/01_html/ex3/index.html
```
Now you can commit these changes to your repository with git commit. It will open a text editor where you can write a message for the commit that reflects the changes that you've done. You can also just type the commit message alongside the command with -m switch, for example:
```
$ git commit -m "Solved the first exercise"
[main ab66b8d] Solved the first exercise
1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletion(-)
```
On many bash systems the default editor is vim. While it is an awesome editor there is a learning curve. Hints of the day: i for insert mode. Your message ESC to exit insert mode. :wq write and quit.

Now the commit is done and the changes you've made to the files that you committed are tracked in the repository history. You can verify this by command git log.The first entry should look something like this:
```
$ git log
commit 2b9c171c4f051cd46b5ce3d77141aaef5bfdce9a
Author: Firstname Lastname <YOUR_USER_NAME@tuni.fi>
Date:   Sun Jan 17 19:01:29 2024 +0300
```

**Solved the first exercise**  
What remains is pushing these changes to your remote repository in GitLab server which is known as "origin" of your clone. This can be done with git push:
```
$ git push origin main
Counting objects: 7, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 345 bytes, done.
Total 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To git@course-gitlab.tuni.fi:intro-2-full-stack-fall2024/YOUR_USERNAME.git
eb2fdc8..ab66b8d  main -> main
```
If there were no errors the changes are now reflected in GitLab (you can browse your project's files if you want to verify this). If you want to brush up your git skills try this.
