## Express Sessions

### Express Sessions

**Exercise instructions**

**Exercise Overview**  
In this exercise, you will implement session management in an Express.js application using express-session. You will create a login system where users can "log in" and "log out" using sessions. The server will remember if a user is logged in and restrict access to certain routes based on the session.

**Solving the exercise**  
Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its exercises/lect05/ex6 directory. You should see the server.js file in this directory. Before completing the TODOs in the file, proceed the following steps to set up the environment:

  - Install the express and express-session packages: npm install --save-dev express express-session.

Open server.js and complete the TODOs:

1. Handle Login:
  - Create a GET request to /login that displays a simple HTML form asking for a username.
  - Create a POST request to /login that handles form submissions, storing the provided username in the session object req.session.username.
  - Redirect to /profile if the user has already logged in.

2. Display User Profile
  - Create a /profile route that checks if the user is logged in (i.e., if the session contains a username).
  - If the user is logged in, display the profile page with a welcome message; otherwise, redirect them to the /login route.

3. Logout
  - Implement a /logout route that destroys the user's session and redirects them back to the home page.

**Expected Outcome and Testing**  
You can start the server with node server.js. A functional application should have the following behavior:

  - When users visit the /login route, they can log in with a username.
  - Once logged in, they are redirected to the /profile route, which displays a personalized welcome message.
  - Users can log out by visiting the /logout route, which ends the session and redirects them to the home page.


Remember to commit server.js
