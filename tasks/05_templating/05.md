## Express.js

### Express.js

**Exercise instructions**

**Exercise Overview**  
Your task is to create a simple web server using Express.js that handles basic routes and responds with text or JSON data. The goal of this exercise is to help you learn how to set up routes in Express.js and send responses based on the route.

**Solving the exercise**   
Before coding:
  - Ensure that you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its exercises/05_cookie/ex5 directory.
  - Install necessary dependencies, including Express.js: npm install


Open server.js and follow the TODOs:
  - Create a route that responds with "Welcome to my simple Express.js server!" when the user visits /.
  - Create a route that responds with "This is the about page." when the user visits /about.
  - Create a route that responds with JSON data for email and phone when the user visits /contact. Look at the commented code to see what the exact JSON data is.
  - Create a route that responds with "Hello, username! You are age years old." when the user visits /user/:username with a query parameter age. If such query parameter is not provided, the route should respond with "Hello, username! Age not provided."

**Testing**
  - Run the server: node server.js.
  - Go to http://localhost:3000/ to see the home page. Compare the server response to the instructions.
  - Repeat with the rest of the pages (/about, /contact, and user/username) and check the response.
  - The age query parameter can be added as /user/username?age=18.
  - Check the console for potential errors and fix your code.
  - Stop the server when you are done.

Remember to commit server.js
