## Read Cookie

### Read Cookie

**Exercise instructions**

**Exercise Overview**  
In this exercise you are going to read the cookie value that you set from the previous exercise and display it on the page.

**Solving the exercise**  
Go to your project repository. Use git pull course-upstream main to update the content from the upstream. You should be able to see an empty directory exercises/05_cookie/ex3. Go to that directory and proceed with the following steps:

  - Open script.js.
  - Copy the setCookies function from the previous exercise to script.js.
  - Write getCookie(name) that returns the cookie value based on cookie name.
  - For example, if your input field for text1 is TestValue1, getCookie("text1") should return TestValue1
  - The retrieved cookie value should be displayed in a HTML element with a specific id property:
        - text1Cookie for text1
        - text2Cookie for text2
        - checkboxCookie for checkbox

**Testing**  
  - Test your solution similar to the previous exercise: At the same directory, run npm install and node server.js.
  - Open localhost:3000 in your browser. Fill in the form and click the Submit button.
  - A successful implementation should result in a webpage like the following image.
