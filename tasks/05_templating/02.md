## Set Cookie

### Set Cookie

Before you start this exercise round, go to your local GitLab repository clone on your machine. There git pull course-upstream main to fetch new content from the course upstream.

**Exercise instructions**

**Exercise Overview**  
In this exercise you will create a setCookies() function that read input values from a form and set them as cookies. The function should do the following:

  - The code should fetch the input value of 2 text areas and the checkbox of the provided form.
  - Those values will be then saved to cookies. For text inputs, it will be saved directly as input value; for the checkbox, it should be saved as true if it is checked and false if not checked
  - The key for each cookie value is its own HTML element id.
  - For example, if the text value for Text 1 is John and Text 2 is Doe and the checkbox is checked, the cookies are text1=John, text2=Doe, checkbox=true.

**Solving the exercise**   
Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its exercises/05_cookies/ex2 directory. Then:

  - Write your code into script.js file inside this directory. Inside this file you will find the starting code of this exercise. Your task is to implement the function setCookies() inside that file.
  - You can find the HTML in the index.html file inside this directory that implements the form. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
  - You can find the server code in the server.js file inside this directory which will be used for testing.  DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
    

**Testing**  
You can test the implementation manually on the browser:

  - Install testing libraries: npm install.
  - Launch the predefined server: node server.js.
  - Open localhost:3000.
  - Open the browser console by pressing Ctrl + Shift + I or F12.
  - Switch to the Storage tab (Firefox) or Application (other browsers) and select the Cookies dropdown, then select http://localhost:3000.

  - NOTE: You may need to hit the reload button at the top left corner of the Cookies page to see the changes.
