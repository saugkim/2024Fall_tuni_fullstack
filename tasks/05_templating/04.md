## Server-side Sessions

### Server-side Sessions

**Exercise instructions**

**Exercise Overview**  
In this exercise, you will learn how to implement basic server-side session management in a Node.js application without using any external frameworks. The goal is to maintain user state across multiple HTTP requests using cookies to identify the user and an in-memory store to save session data.

You will:
  - Parse cookies from incoming requests to identify the user session.
  - Return session data back to the client to demonstrate how session state is preserved across multiple requests.

For example, the server will handle a URL like /set?key=name&value=John to store name: John in the user's session.

**Solving the exercise**  
Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its exercises/05_cookie/ex4 directory. You should see the sessions.js file in this directory. Open the file and complete the following TODOs:

  - Parse cookies from the request headers and extract the session ID. Save the session ID in variable sessionId.
  - Check if the session ID exists in the session store. If not, create a new session using createSession() function.
  - After generated, set the session ID as a cookie in the response headers. The cookie should have key sessionId and value of the variable sessionId mentioned above.

The template already handled the /set URL path and query parameters to store session data, so you don't need to be worried about it.


**Test the implementation**  
  - Run the server by executing node sessions.js in the terminal. The server will start listening on port 3000. Open the web browser at this port.
  - Open the Cookies tab in browser console and check if the sessionId is visible.
  - Try to access the localhost:3000/set?key=name&value=John URL and refresh the page. You should see the session data displayed on the page with the text Session Updated: {"name":"John"}.
  - Go back to localhost:3000, the session data should still be visible but with the text Session Data: {"name":"John"}.
  - Access the /set path with more different key-value pair and the session data should be appended.

**Hints**  
  - The querystring library has a .parse function that can be used to extract the session ID. Click here to check the function's documentation.
  - Optional: Using HttpOnly when setting the cookie will reduce the risk of client side script accessing the protected cookie. Check HttpOnly's documentation.


Remember to commit sessions.js
