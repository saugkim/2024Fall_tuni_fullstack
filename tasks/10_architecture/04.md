## Middleware has their own place

### Move middleware to their own files

**Middleware can have their own place, as well**

Make sure to check 10.1 for an overview of the files and folders.

We often use middleware to protect routes from unauthenticated users. We can have, for example, RBAC for authorizing certain actions, but limiting routes to only logged in users is such common need, that it is usually completed via middleware. In this exercise, let's add a middleware we can use to limit some routes to only logged in users.

Solving the Exercise  
Create a folder middleware/ at the root of exercises/10_architecture. In there, add a file sessionAuthMiddleware.js. This file should export an anonymous function that does exactly what the usersOnly(req, res, next) function did in the old app.js.

Once you have the functionality migrated and the old code cleaned up from app.js, you should make use of that middleware. Require the sessionAuthMiddleware in routes/events.js and use it in all of the routes. Remember, that a middleware can be added after the uri and before the controller method in the route mapping. Add the same middleware also to the logout route in routes/users.js. This last one is not super important, but logically, you should not be able to log out, unless you are logged in.

Before submitted for grading, you can run the test locally with the command:

```
npm test .\test\middleware.test.js
```
