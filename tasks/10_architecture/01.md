### 10. Architecture: MVC

It is possible to complete round 10 exercises even if you have not done rounds 8 & 9. Model tests are included in course-upstream for your benefit, but if you have not implemented said models, you may remove them or simply only run the tests related to these exercises. If you want feature test coverage, you can import users.test.js and events.test.js from round 8 files, but you'll have to replace the exportUsers() and exportEvents() checks with calls to database. Plussa, however, expects only the tests listed in the exercises.


**Overview of files and folders**  
In this final exercise round, we'll keep working on the sample application from previous rounds, making it conform to MVC architecture. In doing so, we'll also break the code from app.js into smaller parts and organize those parts in files and folders. Below is the structure of files and folders that you should aim for.

```
config                          //All config items should be easily accessible
    ├── database.js                 //Exports connectDB function
    ├── mongoose.js                 //Mongoose is required here and only here, all others get it through this
    └── session.js                  //Exports sessionConfig
    controllers                     //Controller files
    ├── apiController.js            //Controller for ex5 API
    ├── eventController.js
    └── userController.js
    middleware
    ├── sessionAuthMiddleware.js    //Protects normal routes
    └── tokenAuthMiddleware.js      //Protects API routes
    models
    ├── Event.js                    //You can use your models from round09, but make sure not to require mongoose directly
    └── User.js
    public
    └── css
        └── main.css
    routes                          //Routes pretty much list the functionality of the application
    ├── api.js                      //Routes for ex5 API
    ├── events.js
    └── users.js
    test
    ├── config.test.js              //ex2
    ├── controllers.test.js         //ex3
    ├── env.test.js
    ├── eventModel.test.js
    ├── ex5controllers.test.js      //ex5
    ├── ex5env.test.js              //ex5
    ├── ex5middleware.test.js       //ex5
    ├── ex5routes.test.js           //ex5
    ├── middleware.test.js          //ex4
    ├── routes.test.js              //ex3
    ├── test-setup.js
    └── userModel.test.js
    views
    ├── events
    │   ├── create.ejs
    │   ├── edit.ejs
    │   └── index.ejs
    ├── partials
    │   ├── _errors.ejs
    │   ├── _footer.ejs
    │   ├── _header.ejs
    │   └── _nav.ejs
    ├── login.ejs
    └── register.ejs
    .env
    .gitignore
    app.js
    package-lock.json
    package.json
    server.js
```

All configuration related items should be in one place (here, config/) and preferrably in their own files. This makes them easy to find.

Functionality is moved to controllers and their methods. Event related functionality is in event controller, user related in user controller. API related functionality has a bit of both, but when the amount of methods is very low, breaking it to smaller controller might not make the architecture any clearer.

Routes can be protected by adding middleware to them. In middleware/, there are the session-based protection for "normal" routes and the token-based protection for API routes.

All routes are defined in one place, routes/, but divided into their own files. If you want to know what api functionality this application offers, the easiest way, in my opinion, would be to first check the routes file. That should already give you a pretty good idea of what's offered.
