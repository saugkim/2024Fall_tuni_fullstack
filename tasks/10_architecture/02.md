Make sure to check 10.1 for an overview of the files and folders.

It's important to have configuration outside the application code and so that it can be easily found. Now, it's hidden somewhere inside the application code.

Solving the Exercise  
In the folder config/ at the root of exercises/10_architecture, add the following files:

database.js

Requires ./mongoose.js, defines async connectDB() function that connects to database using MONGO_URI from .env, exports connectDB.


mongoose.js

This file is already provided. This requires mongoose and then exports it. All other files, that want to reference mongoose, must require it through here. Otherwise, sometimes, mongoose !== mongoose.

session.js

Requires express-session, defines const sessionConfig = session({... passing it SESSION_SECRET from .env as secret, resave: false, saveUninitialized: true. Exports sessionConfig.

In app.js, require connectDB from ./config/database and sessionConfig from ./config/session. After const app = express(), call connectDB() and app.use(sessionConfig). The aim after all exercises is to remove all other database or session related lines from app.js. It should not need to require mongoose or express-session.


Before submitted for grading, you can run the test locally with the command:

```
npm test .\test\config.test.js
```
