## Extending application with new features

### The client really wants a mobile app

**Adding an API**

Make sure to check 10.1 for an overview of the files and folders.

This last exercise should bring together a lot of topics from this and previous rounds. We now have a somewhat functional small web application, and our client is thrilled. So much, in fact, that they want a mobile app for event management and for that, they want us to open a REST API for accessing our event data.

They want their mobile application to be able to list all events, show an event and to update an event.

The mobile application has it's own UI, so all data should be in JSON format, not HTML.

The data should also remain secure. The mobile app will send a POST request with an email and a password. If those match our records, we should respond with a JWT token. All other API routes should require a valid token.

There's several things to add. I try not to give too detailed instructions, but none of this should be new at this point.

**controllers/apiController.js**  
This controller exports methods all (return all events as JSON), show (return requested event as JSON), update (replace the requested event with the provided event if the requested event exists, create a new event if it doesn't), and login (authenticate the user and respond with a signed token or HTTP 401)

**.env**  
Add JWT_SECRET key and a 32 characters long value to use as secret for JWT sign and verify

**middleware/tokenAuthMiddleware.js**  
This middleware checks that the request has a header Authorization, that header starts with Bearer, and what comes after is a valid JWT token. Otherwise, HTTP 401.

**routes/api.js**  
HTTP GET /api/events uses tokenAuthMiddleware and maps to apiController.all. HTTP GET /api/events/:id uses tokenAuthMiddleware and maps to apiController.show. HTTP PUT /api/events/:id uses tokenAuthMiddleware and maps to apiController.update. HTTP POST /api/login maps to apiController.login.

**app.js**  
Requires the api routes and uses them with app.use('/', apiRoutes);
This instruction might not be all-covering, but the idea is, that after this round, you have a fully working web application. Futher, after this exercise, the application should have a working API with token-based authentication (you can test it manually using Postman or cUrl).

Before submitted for grading, you can run the test locally with the command:

```
npm test .\test\ex5controllers.test.js

npm test .\test\ex5middleware.test.js

npm test .\test\ex5routes.test.js

npm test .\test\ex5env.test.js
```
