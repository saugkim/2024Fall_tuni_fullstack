## Split code to controllers

### From app.js to controller methods

**Adding controllers and routing to controllers**

Make sure to check 10.1 for an overview of the files and folders.

We've added the (V)iews in round 8 and (M)odels in round 9, so the only component missing from MVC is the (C)ontrollers. In web applications, there's also another important component, router, that maps the HTTP requests to the controller methods. Let's add both in this exercise.

Solving the Exercise   
Create two folders, controllers/ and routes/, both at the root of exercises/10_architecture. Inside controllers/, add two files, eventController.js and userController.js. Inside routes/, add two files, events.js and users.js.

Migrate code from app.js to controller methods  
In the original app.js we have event related actions, such as app.get('/', usersOnly, async (req, res) => { ... that loads all events from the database and renders the view events/index to show them. Now, it needs to be moved to a method on a controller. To illustrate, I'll show two samples here and leave the rest for you:

```
      //part of old app.js...
      app.get('/events', usersOnly, async (req, res) => {
        const user = req.session.user;
        const events = await Event.find();
        return res.render('events/index', { title: 'Dashboard', user, events });
      });

      //... and the same functionality as controller method in eventController.js
      const Event = require('../models/Event');
      exports.all = async (req, res) => {
        const user = req.session.user;
        const events = await Event.find();
        return res.render('events/index', { title: 'Dashboard', user, events });
      };

      //another part of old app.js...
      app.post('/logout', (req, res) => {
        req.session.destroy();
        return res.redirect('/login');
      });

      //... and the same functionality as controller method in usersController.js
      exports.logout = (req, res) => {
        req.session.destroy();
        return res.redirect('/login');
      };
```
    
The controller methods to implement in eventController.js are

```
Method to add	          Was in old app.js	            Description
eventController.all	 app.get('/events')	          Show all events
eventController.create	app.get('/events/create')	    Shows a form to create a new event
eventController.store	  app.post('/events')	          Stores a new event
eventController.edit	  app.get('/events/:id')	      Shows a form to edit an event
eventController.update	app.post('/events/:id')	      Updates an event
eventController.delete	app.post('/events/:id/delete')	Deletes an event
```

The controller methods to implement in userController.js are
```
Method to add	Was in old app.js	Description
userController.renderLoginForm	app.get('/login')	Render login form
userController.login	app.post('/login')	Auhtenticate user
userController.logout	app.post('/logout')	Log out user
userController.renderRegisterForm	app.get('/register')	Shows a form to register a new user
userController.register	app.post('/register')	Persist a new user
```

*Mapping requests to controller methods*  

In routes/events.js, you'll need to require express, instantiate router as express.Router(), and require eventsController. Then, you can map a request to a method as follows: router.get('/events', eventController.all);. At the end, remember to export router. Add the following request to method mappings in routes/events.js:

```
HTTP GET /events -> eventController.all
HTTP GET /events/create -> eventController.create
HTTP POST /events -> eventController.store
HTTP GET /events/:id -> eventController.edit
HTTP POST /events/:id -> eventController.update
HTTP POST /events/:id/delete -> eventController.delete
```

In routes/users.js,  
you'll need to require express, instantiate router as express.Router(), and require usersController and at the end, export router. Add the following request to method mappings in routes/users.js:

```
HTTP GET /login -> userController.renderLoginForm
HTTP POST /login -> userController.login
HTTP POST /logout -> userController.logout
HTTP GET /register -> userController.renderRegisterForm
HTTP POST /register -> userController.register
```

Finally, in app.js, you can remove all functionality, that's now moved to other files. At the top, require the route mapping files (e.g., const eventRoutes = require('./routes/events');). Finally, before exporting app, set it to use the required routes (e.g., app.use('/', eventRoutes);). Do this for both the event routes and the user routes. A smart IDE or editor will highlight unused requires and unused variables, so you should be able to remove a vast majority of lines from app.js.

Before submitted for grading, you can run the test locally with the command:

```
npm test .\test\controllers.test.js

npm test .\test\routes.test.js
```
