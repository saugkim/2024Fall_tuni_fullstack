## Routing

### Routing

**Routing based on request's URL path**

**Exercise overview**  
In this exercise you get to implement a Node.js server, which is able to route incoming requests based on the path the request is directed to.

For example, in a request to localhost:3000/resources/23, the /resources/23 forms the path part of the URL.

**Solving the Exercise**  
Ensure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, specifically in the exercises/04_http/ex6 directory. Then follow these steps:

  - Create a file named index.js in this directory. You will write your server code in this file.
  - When the server receives a request, read the path part of the URL. Refer to the Echo server's routing example for more information on how to do this. Note: For routing conditions/decisions in this exercise, use only the URL path, not the HTTP method.
  - For requests to the path /classical, send the contents of the homer.html file from this directory.
  - For requests to the path /dystopy, send the contents of the bradbury.html file from this directory.
  - For requests to the default path /, respond with the contents of the index.html file from this directory.
  - For requests to any other paths, respond with an HTTP status code 404 and the status message 'Requested content not found'.
  - You can copy the readFileSendResponse(fileName, contentType, response) function from the exercise 4.5 index.js file to handle reading files and sending responses. Alternatively, you can use the response's write and end methods as described below.
  - Use the response's write method to add the body to the response. Note: We are not writing to the response body, but to the Reason Phrase, hence the status message.
  - Use the response's end method to finish adding to the response and send it to the client.
  - Run your server by executing the command node index.js in this directory.
  - Correct any possible mistakes.
Commit your index.js file and push it to your Git repository.
