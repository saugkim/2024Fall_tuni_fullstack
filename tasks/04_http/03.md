## Request headers

**Request headers**

**Exercise overview**  
In this exercise you will create a Node server, which will respond to any incoming requests by sending the headers object from that request as html.

**Solving the exercise**  
Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its exercises/04_http/ex3 directory. Then:

  - Create a new file called index.js inside the current directory.
  - In the index.js file, write your server code using the createServer method from the built-in http module.
  - Use the writeHead method of the response object to set the HTTP response status code to 200 and the content type to "text/html".
  - Inside the callback function of the createServer method, access the HTTP headers from the incoming request using the message.headers object.
  - Convert the headers object to a string using the JSON.stringify method.
  - Use the write method of the response object to add the stringified headers to the response.
  - End the response and send it to the client using the end method.
  - To run your server, execute the command node index.js in the current directory.
  - Make sure to correct any mistakes and test your server.
  - Commit the index.js file and push it to your Git repository.
  - Submit your work in Plussa.
  - Bonus: consider whether the content type of text/html is appropriate for this type of content.
