## Node.js: createServer

### Node.js createServer

Before you start this exercise round, you need to fetch the remote changes from the course-upstream repository. So, on your development machine change to the local directory where you cloned your GitLab repository. In that directory first run git fetch course-upstream and then git pull course-upstream main to automagically fetch and merge new content from the course upstream to your local working directory.

While you are pulling the changes from course-upstream, a text editor might open with a merge message. The file usually starts with a line like "Merge branch 'main' of course-gitlab.tuni.fi:intro-2-full-stack-fall2024/course-upstream into main". You can just save that file and close the editor. As we learned from the first exercise round exercise Hello Git, on many bash systems the default editor is vim. While it is an awesome editor there is a learning curve. Hints of the day:

i for insert mode. Your message ESC to exit insert mode. :wq write and quit insert mode.

**Node.js create server**

The main source for exercises in this second exercise round is the Node.js v18 documentation (as used in Vagrant).

For getting started with creating a Node.js server which sends responses to user's programs requests, you should read the Anatomy of a HTTP Transaction tutorial, and view a student-proposed video Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #12 - Creating a Server.

**Exercise overview**  
In this exercise, you will create a server using Node.js's built-in http module's createServer method.

The implemented server must have the following functionality:

  - The created server listens for requests on localhost's port 3000.
  - When a user uses their browser, curl, or some other program to send a request to the server's root path '/' (for example localhost:3000/), the server responds by reading the contents of the index.html file in this directory and sending it as a response to the user.

**Solving the Exercise**  
Make sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, specifically in the exercises/04_http/ex2 directory. To complete the exercise, follow the 2 TODO bullet points below. However, we recommend reading the entire list to understand the content of the index.js file.

  - In the server code in index.js, the createServer method is used to create the server object. The Anatomy of an HTTP Transaction tutorial provides useful examples for using this method. The createServer method takes two parameters, request and response, which represent the client's request and the server's response, respectively. These are often abbreviated as req and res. Inside the callback function of the server, you can use these objects with the names you assign to them:
```
// This comment is OUTSIDE the createServer's callback function
const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    // This comment is INSIDE the createServer's callback function
  });
// This comment is OUTSIDE the createServer's callback function
```
  - Inside the createServer method's callback, use Node.js's built-in fs module's readFile method to read the existing index.html file from the directory. Currently, there is a placeholder FILE_NAME_HERE in its place.
  - TODO: Replace FILE_NAME_HERE in index.js with index.html.
  - response's writeHead method is used to set the HTTP response status code to 202 ("OK") and the content type to "text/html".
  - TODO: Replace the placeholder FILE_TYPE_HERE with the appropriate file type.
  - response's write method is used to add the data read from the index.html file to the response.
  - response's end method is used to finish adding to the response and send it to the client.
  - Run your server by executing the command node index.js in this directory.
  - Correct any possible mistakes.
  - Commit your index.js file and push it to your Git repository.
  - Submit your work in Plussa.

**About Testing**  
  - It's a good idea to have one terminal window (Vagrant terminal if using Vagrant or another terminal) always open for running the server code during development and testing. Use this terminal window to run nodemon index.js or node index.js, and keep it open to keep the server running.
  - For debugging your Node.js program with Visual Studio Code, see the section "Debugging Node.js Applications with Visual Studio Code (VS Code)" under the exercise round study materials.
  - You can send requests to the server using your own browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.) running on your own OS (Linux, Windows, macOS, etc). Just enter localhost:3000 in the browser's URL bar.
  - Note for testing: When communicating with the server, Chrome (and likely some other browsers) might send two requests. The first request fetches the favicon, and the second one fetches the proper content from the server. This should be taken into consideration when testing the code and is not considered a bug in the student's exercise code.
  - It is recommended to test by sending a request with curl, Postman, or similar software to avoid the two-requests problem. In the Vagrant terminal, you can run the command curl localhost:3000 to send a request.
