## API testing

### Test API with mocha

**API testing**

**Solving the Exercise**  
Ensure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, specifically in the exercises/04_http/ex7 directory. Then follow these steps:

  - Copy the index.js file in the exercise 4.6 from the directory ../ex6 in to this directory, for example with command cp ../ex6/index.js .
  - Create a package.json file for this exercise: npm init -y.
  - Install the mocha, chai, and chai-http libraries as development dependencies: npm install --save-dev mocha chai@4 chai-http. This command fetches the modules and adds them to devDependencies section of the package.json file.
  - You can edit the scripts property in package.json to run the tests easier. Edit the scripts section:
``` 
      "scripts": {
          "test": "mocha --timeout 10000"
      },
```
After this, you can run your tests by executing the command npm test in this directory.
  - Edit the index.js file to make the server exportable as a module, which is required by the chai-http module. You can do this by exporting your createServer function with module.exports. For example, change the line:
```
      http.createServer((request, response) => {
```
to:
```
      module.exports = http.createServer((request, response) => {
```
  - Write your tests in the existing /test/api.js file. This file already contains code for requiring the necessary modules and reading the HTML files.
  - In the /test/api.js file, there are TODO comments indicating where you need to write your tests. Do not make any other changes to this file.
  - Correct any possible mistakes.
  - Commit your index.js, package.json, and test/api.js files and push them to your Git repository.
  - Submit your work in Plussa.
