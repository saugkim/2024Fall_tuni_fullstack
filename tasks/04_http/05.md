## Content types

**Content types**

**Exercise overview**  
In this exercise you create a Node.js server which can send the clients data in the format they request. The data is only available in XML, JSON, or text content types. The data comes from files in corresponding formats in this exercise directory.

For this exercise you can assume that the client only accepts one content type. In reality browsers send Accept headers, which lists accepted content types in ordered lists.

**Solving the exercise**  
Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its exercises/04_http/ex5 directory. Then:

  - Write your server code in index.js file in the exercise directory. Study the contents of the file carefully before continuing the exercise.
  - In this exercise you need to implement the TODO in the index.js file. Read on for instructions.
  - Inside createServer method's callback, you need to read the incoming request's Accept header to find in which format the client wishes to receive the data. For accessing the header value request.headers['accept'] can be used. You have to read the Accept header value and compare it to the values for the content types: see Common MIME types for more information. To simplify things, you only need to handle the MIME types associated with the file types in this exercise, which are listed in the table below:


|File type|	MIME type in this exercise|	Associated file|
|:--|:--|:--|
|TXT|	text/plain|	data.txt|
|CSS|	text/css|	data.css|
|HTML|	text/html|	data.html|
|XML|	application/xml|	data.xml|
|JSON|	application/json|	data.json|
|ZIP|	application/zip|	data.zip|
|All formats|	\*/\*	|data.txt|

  - For any of the JSON, XML, CSS, HTML, ZIP or TXT formats read the correct file for that format, and send it as response to the client, with the correct HTTP status code. The files are: data.json, data.xml, data.css, data.html, data.zip and data.txt. For info on how to read a file, refer to exercise 4.2.
  - If any format is acceptable to client (indicated by header: 'Accept': '*/*''), send the text format data.
  - If request specifies any content type other than JSON, XML, HTML, CSS, ZIP or text, send a response with 406 HTTP status code and status message "Content type not available". Both status code and status message are properties, not methods, so you can just assign a value to them.
  - Use response's write method to add the body to the response.
  - Use response's end method to end adding to the response, and send it to the client.
  - You can run your server by running the command node index.js in this directory.
  - Correct any possible mistakes.
