**Debugging Node.js applications with Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

The easy and basic way of debugging Node.js is by inserting console.log output in your Node.js code. The output will be visible on the same terminal where you started your Node.js application. While this works, it is highly recommended that you invest a bit of time to set up VS Code for debugging Node.js code.

With VS Code set up for debugging Node.js, you can use its tools and extensions for debugging your applications. For more information on Node.js debugging in VS Code, refer to the official documentation.

(Only for Vagrant users) To set up debugging for Node.js applications running inside Vagrant, you need to follow these steps:
```
Install the remote development debugging extension for VS Code.
Open VS Code and launch the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+P.
In the Command Palette, copy-paste the line ext install ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack and press Enter to install the extension.
After a successful installation, you should see the Remote Explorer icon in the side bar and have access to commands from the Remote Development extension.
Open a new terminal window on your local machine (not inside Vagrant) and navigate to the root directory of your local clone of the repository where the Vagrantfile is located.
Run the command vagrant up to start Vagrant.
Once Vagrant is up, run the command vagrant ssh-config in the terminal to print out the SSH setup for Vagrant.
Copy the output from the vagrant ssh-config command, making sure to change the first line from Host default to Host vagrant.
Go back to VS Code and open the Command Palette again.
Type remote-ssh: open ssh configuration file... in the Command Palette and select the command from the list.
In the "Select SSH configuration file to update" prompt, select the first listed config file or specify a custom configuration file.
Paste the Vagrant SSH setup information at the top of the SSH config file and save the file.
Open the Command Palette again and type remote explorer: focus on ssh targets view.
Select the command from the list to focus on the SSH targets view in the side panel.
In the SSH targets view, click on the vagrant SSH server option.
Right-click on the vagrant SSH target and select "Connect to Host in New Window".
In the new VS Code window that opens, click "Open folder" and select the /webdev1/ directory.
You should now be able to see the files inside your repository in the new VS Code window.
```
