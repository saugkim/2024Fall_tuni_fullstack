## Echo server

**Echo server**

**Exercise overview**  
In this exercise you will create a Node.js server, which reads the body of the incoming requests, and sends that same body as response in reverse. So, the server reverses and echoes the request body.

The section Echo Server Example of the Anatomy of a HTTP Transaction documentation should be helpful in this exercise.

**Solving the exercise**  
Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its exercises/04_http/ex4 directory. Then:

  - Inside this directory, create a index.js file. You will write your server code to it.
  - Inside createServer callback method, you need to capture the events that are emitted when message body is being received. For a quick reminder on how to do this, read Node tutorial's example.
  - Use response's writeHead to set the correct HTTP response status code 200 and content type text/plain for the response.
  - Use response's write method to add the body to the response.
  - Use response's end method to end adding to the response, and send it to the client.
  - You can run your server by running the command node index.js in this directory
  - You can test the server for example with curl. While the server is running, you can run the following curl command in a separate terminal window:
```
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:3000' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--data-raw 'All together now!'
```
The server's response body should be !won rehtegot llA.

  - You can compare your implementation with Anatomy of an HTTP transaction's Echo server section.
  - Correct all possible mistakes.
  - Commit your index.js file and push it to your Git repository.
