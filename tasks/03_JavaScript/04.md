## Events Triggered and Emitted

**Exercise instructions**

**Exercise Overview**  
In this exercise, you will implement a dice rolling application that keeps track of the total count for each number rolled, as well as the total count of dice rolls. After each roll, the application should update the counts and display the latest value rolled on the dice rolling button. The gif below demonstrates the expected behavior when the dice rolling button is clicked repeatedly:

**Solving the exercise**  
Start by navigating to the exercises/03_javascript/ex4 directory in your local clone of the Git repository.


In this exercise, you are going to use event listeners to listen and react to a custom event. You can learn more about custom events from this YouTube video.


This time you will create an application that keeps track of individual dice rolls. The function rollDice() for dice rolling is provided and it will trigger a custom event rollDice on document every time it is called. You can get the value of the roll with event.detail.value inside your code. The custom event will have the value of the dice roll included and your task is to listen to the event and update the HTML according to the value.

Write your code into custom-events.js file inside the exercise directory.
You can find the HTML in the index.html file inside this directory. Open this file in your browser. Open the developer console too so that you will see any errors in your code. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
Add a listener for the click event on the roll-button button and call the rollDice() function once on every click.
Listen to the custom rollDice event triggered on the document whenever the rollDice() function is called. Inspect the triggered event and retrieve the current value of the roll. Update the appropriate counters and the button value based on the latest roll. You can use the template tags inside the HTML to choose the appropriate HTML for the button contents. It is recommended to create separate event listeners to handle each counter and the button individually. Remember that multiple listeners can be attached to the same event and they will all be called when the event is triggered.
Every time you are ready to test your code follow these steps:
Save your code.
Reload the index.html page.
Click the dice button.
If something went wrong, check the developer console for error messages. Fix any errors and repeat from the first step.
If everything works as expected, the counters should update based on the dice rolls and the button contents should reflect the latest roll. Repeat the roll a few times to ensure everything is still updating correctly.
Congratulations! You have successfully completed the exercise.
The grader will try to roll dice 100 times.

Hints
Counter values and dice rolls are numbers, but the values inside the DOM are strings. If your code doesn't have separate variables to keep track of the totals, make sure to convert the values from the DOM back to numbers before performing any calculations with them. Also, be cautious when comparing numbers with strings, as it can lead to unexpected results.
When updating the button contents with the last rolled dice, it's recommended to replace the existing button contents with the contents of the appropriate template. You can achieve this by setting the button.innerHTML to an empty string and then appending the new contents into it.
Remember to clone the template contents when updating the button to avoid modifying the original template.
