## DOM manipulation

**DOM Manipulation - short instructions**

**Exercise Overview**  
In this exercise you will create a sortTableByColumn(col, table) function that can sort table rows alphabetically based on values in a column. The function has the following characteristics and functionality:

  - The function includes two arguments:
        - col: A number that represents the index of the column that is used to sort the table. Remember that indices start at zero.
        - table: The table element you want to sort.
  - Your code should assume that all values being compared are strings.
  - Your function can and should assume that the table has only one <tbody> element.
  - Only the rows inside the <tbody> element are sorted. <thead> remains untouched.
  - The order of entire rows is changed rather than just the cells in the selected column.
  - Every sorting of the table uses the current order of the table rows as its starting point and not the original order of the rows. This prevents hard-coded solutions that would work only with the provided data.

**Solving the exercise**  
Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in the exercises/03_javascript/ex2 directory. Then:

  - Open the dom-manipulation.js file inside this directory. Write your implementation in the sortTableByColumn(col, table) function. Do not edit anything else inside this file!
  - You can find the HTML in the index.html file inside this directory. Open this file in your browser.   -Remember to open the developer console to see any errors in your code. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
  - The dom-manipulation.js file has some code you are not supposed to edit at all. This code is used to create and add event listeners for the click events of every table heading (th HTML element) inside the table HTML element. Those event handlers call the function sortTableByColumn(col, table) with correct column and table values. You should NOT call the sortTableByColumn() function yourself!
  - Every time you are ready to test your code follow these steps:
        - save your code
        - reload the index.html page
        - click any of the headings in the table
        - If something went wrong you are likely to see some error messages inside the browser's Developer Tools' console. Fix the errors and try again from the first step.
        - If everything works as expected your table should now be sorted based on the values inside that column. Click other headings and see if everything still works. If table is correctly sorted you are done. Congratulations!
    
Your function will be tested with different table and data. Your code should NOT assume that the table has five rows and three columns!

**Hints**  
   -If you append the same node to the DOM tree many times, it does not create a new copy of the node but moves the same original node to a new place in the DOM. This can be useful when you need to reorder the rows in the table.
  - You should not try to sort collections from querySelectorAll(), getElementsByTagName(), and getElementsByClassName() directly. Instead, you can create an array first, sort that, then use that sorted array to reorder the table rows in the DOM. In some approaches to solve this exercise, JavaScript's   -     Array.from() method could become handy in creating the array.
  - JavaScript Array's sort() method can be very useful when an actual JavaScript array has been created.
  - While sorting the rows, you need to compare the values in the selected column. You should use localeCompare() to compare the values in the column.
