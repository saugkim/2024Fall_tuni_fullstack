## Using async/await

### setTimeout() with async/await

Before solving exercise 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, please fetch the course upstream to get the latest updates. Go to the exercises/06_async directory and run npm install. This will help the local mocha tests for each exercise run normally.

**Exercise instructions**

**Exercise Overview**  
  - In the last phase, the study of asynchronous practices ends up with async/await. Here, setTimeout() is inserted in an async function that will be iteratively called in the drawArrows() function, inside an IIFE: Immediately Invoked Function Expression.
  - As IIFE, an async block can be inserted inside otherwise synchronous function, like drawArrows(). Now, your task is to replace the recursion with an IIFE that contains iteration (for loop). The loop could call an async function to draw an arrow in a timed-out manner. Also promises can be mixed with the async/await implementation.

**Solving the exercise**  
  - Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its exercises/06_async/ex6 directory.
  - Implement TODOs in async.js in the directory /exercises/06_async/ex6.
  - Check that index.html shows the animation.

**Testing**  
  - Mocha tests are available in ex6/test.
  - Install testing packages:npm install.
  - Run the grader tests locally: npm test.


Remember to commit async.js and push the changes
