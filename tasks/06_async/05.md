## Using Promises

### setTimeout() promisified

Before solving exercise 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, please fetch the course upstream to get the latest updates. Go to the exercises/06_async directory and run npm install. This will help the local mocha tests for each exercise run normally.

**Exercise instructions**

**Exercise Overview**   
  - This exercise continues the animation that was done in the previous exercise. In this exercise, drawArrows() function and more specifically, its setTimeout() call, is promisified.
  - Ideally, asynchronous functions would return promises, and would be recognizable as asynchronous already from their function signature, when marked with async keyword. Unfortunately, some commonly used older web APIs, such assetTimeout(), contradict the principle. Yet, with the popularity and an expressive name, setTimeout() is in a relatively good position that one can expect the asynchronous behavior from it.
  - MDN declares the procedure that is required to "promisify" an old web APIs, such as setTimeout():
  - In this exercise, we wrap setTimeout() function inside a Promise, which is created from scratch with the constructor new. As a parameter, the constructor takes an executor function resolve.

**Solving the exercise**  
  - Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its exercises/06_async/ex5 directory.
  - Implement TODOs in promisified.js that are stored in the dir.
  - Check that index.html shows the animation.

**Testing**  
  - Mocha tests are available in ex5/test.
  - Install testing packages:npm install.
  - Run the grader tests locally: npm test.
