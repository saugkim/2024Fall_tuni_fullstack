## Callbacks: timeout animation

### setTimeout() with callbacks

Before solving exercise 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, please fetch the course upstream to get the latest updates. Go to the exercises/06_async directory and run npm install. This will help the local mocha tests for each exercise run normally.

**Exercise instructions**

**Exercise Overview**  
In this exercise, callback functions are practiced with the setTimeout() functions. The setTimeout() is used to simulate an outside system, like server with a RESTful API. We fetch data from these systems, but we must wait for their response, requiring asynchronous programming.

In this exercise the timeouts are applied to an animation, where an UML sequence diagram is animated.

**JavaScript's setTimeout() callbacks in animation**
  - The drawing below is done with SVG. SVG.js library is saved to the repository for this purpose. See the documentation of SVG.js here.
  - SVG is W3C standard, and its format is XML: it must be valid and well-formed. As SVG is understood by browsers, it can be seen as an extension of HTML. SVG elements may define attributes such as id or class; these attributes can be used with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript. The libraries, such as SVG.js, are built on top of this functionality. In exercises 6.4 - 6.6, the actual functions used for drawing the SVG drawing are provided to students in the repository, they can be found in a file /exercises/06_async/misc/draw.js.
  - UML diagrams are the way to communicate about the structure and design of the software architecture, and these diagrams are frequently embedded to architecture documents. Most commonly used diagrams are the class, sequence and component diagrams. In the image below, on the left, there is an UML sequence diagram's basic structure for reference. The complete sequence of the animation in this exercise on the right:


**Solving the exercise**  
  - Implement TODOs in callback.js file in the directory 06_async/ex4.
  - Open index.html in the browser, and if implemented correctly, you should see the animation running similar to Fig.2.

**Testing**  
  - Mocha tests are available in ex4/test.
  - Install testing packages:npm install.
  - Run the grader tests locally: npm test.
