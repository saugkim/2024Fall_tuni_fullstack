## Using asynchronous functionality in JavaScript

**Exercise instructions**

**Exercise Overview**  
In this exercise you are going to implement simple asynchronous functions.

**Solving the exercise**  
  - Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its exercises/06_async/ex2 directory.
  - Open the file f_skeleton.js and implement the functions according to the TODOs.

**Testing**  
  - Install the testing packages: npm install.
  - Run the grader tests locally: npm test.
  - npm test executes f.test.js that is included in the directory /exercises/06_sync/ex2/test. You can open this file to see the tests that are run, but DO NOT edit it.
