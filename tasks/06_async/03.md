## Using asynchronous functionality in JavaScript: mocha tests

### mocha tests for thenable

**Exercise instructions** 

**Exercise Overview**  
In this exercise, you will first implement thennable. After the implementation you are going to write a test case for the thennable.

**Solving the exercise**  
  - Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its exercises/06_async/ex3 directory.
  - Open the file f_skeleton.js and implement the functions according to the TODOs.
  - Open test/f.test.js and implement the TODO.

**Testing**  
  - Install the testing packages: npm install.
  - Run the grader tests locally: npm test.
  - npm test executes f.test.js that is included in the directory /exercises/06_sync/ex3/test. After finishing the TODOs in both files, the tests should pass.
