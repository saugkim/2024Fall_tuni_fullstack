## User Authorization

**User Authorization**

**Exercise Overview**  
The application ships with two user roles, user and admin. Your task now is to implement role-based access control. This is verified in the tests in test/ex4.test.js, you need to get those to green.

Currently, all authenticated users may delete events with POST /events/:id/delete. We need to restrict that action to only users with the role 'admin'. However, we forsee this to be something we would want to use in multiple locations, so it makes sense to implement it as a middleware.


**Solving the Exercise**  
You need to pass this exercise's tests by implementing a middleware that rejects all such requests, where the requesting user does not have a role of admin. Then, apply this middleware only to the POST /events/:id/delete route.

  - Read about what middleware functions are and how you can apply one to a route.
  - Check the provided code for how the usersOnly middleware is implemented and how it's applied to routes.
  - Implement a "admin only" middleware and apply that to the event deletion route. Note, that you can have several middleware per route.
  - If the requesting user does not have the role "admin", return a redirect back to /events.
  - Extra: Would it make validation easier, if there was a middleware that removed all input values that were empty or only contained white-space characters from the request body? Could you implement one? This might break the current tests, so don't submit that code. Note, that this is a built-in feature of some frameworks.


You should correct all errors reported by running the tests locally: npm test ./test/ex4.test.js. Then commit your work and submit your work to Plussa.
