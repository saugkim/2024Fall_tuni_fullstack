## User Registration

**User Registration**

**Exercise Overview**  
The application ships with two user accounts. Your task now is to implement user registration. This is verified in the tests in test/ex3.test.js, you need to get those to green.

The application has a registration form in views/register.ejs. This is available via GET /register. You'll also find a method stub listening for POST /register, but that's not doing much.

**Solving the Exercise**  
You need to pass this exercise's tests by implementing the TODOs marked in the POST /register in app.js. Check the TODOs for an exhaustive list of steps, here's just a quick overview:

  - Get the name, email, and password from the request body.
  - Validate the data. It's enough to check that they exist and are not empty. Remember, that Express.js sees empty input elements as existing as long as they have a name attribute.
  - Use the provided validation error strings to keep the tests happy.
  - Check if the given email is already in use. If we authenticate with email+password, it is imperative, that the email is unique!
  - If validation fails, use the PRG-pattern to present the validation errors.
  - Otherwise, generate a unique identifier for the new user (uuid() method provided).
  - Make sure the new user starts with the role 'user'.
  - Make sure to bcrypt hash the users password. We will never store passwords in plain text.
  - Push the new user to the users array (since we don't have a database yet).
  - Store the new user in the session so that they are logged in upon successfull registration without having to visit a login form.
  - Extra: In case of validation errors, pre-populate the register forms input fields with the old data, so that the user does not have to type everything again. But only do this for name and email, never for the password.


You should correct all errors reported by running the tests locally: npm test ./test/ex3.test.js. Then commit your work and submit your work to Plussa.
