## Hello ESLint!

### Coding conventions with ESLint

This week you have been working with a larger code base. You may have noticed differences in coding styles: some do not add semicolons and maybe some use '' instead of "", etc.

In small exercises and assignments the coding style does not really matter that much. But once you start working in a real team, it suddenly becomes extremely important. The industry recognizes consistent coding style as one of the key factors for software quality. See for example:

  - Coding standards https://www.multidots.com/blog/importance-of-coding-standard-and-code-quality-in-software-development/
  - Top indicators of good code https://jgefroh.medium.com/why-consistency-is-one-of-the-top-indicators-of-good-code-352ba5d62020

**ESlint to ensure the compliance with the agreed code conventions**

Checking each line by hand is inefficient and repetitive, thus, automating coding convention check comes in handy. The industry standard for linting JavaScript code is ESLint. ESLint works based on the defined rules set in the configuration file .eslintrc.json. Possible rules are plenty, a comprehensive list of available rules in represented in ESLint site: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/.

Moreover, enhancing ESLint with plugins is possible, such as eslint-plugin-fp. Plugins are implemented for special needs. For example, if the project agrees to use FP style, then the ESlint FP plugin may be used to ensure this.

Here's a snippet of what such rules look like in the config file.

```
      "semi": ["error", "always"],
      "no-dupe-else-if": ["error"],
      "eqeqeq": ["error", "always"],
      "no-implicit-globals": "error",
      "no-redeclare": "error",
      "no-promise-executor-return": "error",
      "no-undef": "error",
      "quotes": "off",
      "no-unused-vars": "error",
      "camelcase": "error",
      "arrow-spacing": "warn",
      "no-var": "error",
      "prefer-const": "error",
      "no-unreachable": "error",
      "complexity": ["warn", 10],
      "no-invalid-this": "warn",
      "no-multi-spaces": "warn",
      "no-self-assign": "warn",
      "require-await": "warn",
      "no-shadow": "warn",
      "comma-spacing": "warn",
      "max-lines-per-function": "warn",
      "prefer-object-spread": "warn",
      "prefer-template": "warn"
```

In rules section, there are three categories: "error", "warn", and "off". Some rules have a list of values, such as, semi:
```
"semi": ["error", "always"]
```
and complexity
```
"complexity": ["warn", 10]
```
The first is needed to specify the category, the second parameter is additional information for this specific rule. For example, "semi", semi-colon rule is applied always: every command must end with semi-colon. In complexity, the max number of nested if-else sentences must be ten at maximum.

In this exercise, no errors are permitted, warnings are printed only for information. Next, we will go through the erros more in detail.


|Rule|Explanation|	
|:-- |:-- |
|eqeqeq	|require the use of `===` and `!==`|
|no-dupe-else-if	|each if-else condition must appear only once|
|no-implicit-globals	|no global variables, using const is recommended|
|no-promise-executor-return	|Inside promise executor either resolve, reject, or plain return, no other options|
|no-redeclare	|buildin globals Object, Array, Number must not be used as variable names|
|no-unreachable	|cleaner code: disallows unreachable code after return, throw, continue, and break statements|
|no-var	|discouraging the use of var and encouraging the use of const or let instead.|
|prefer-const	|better maintainability: const tells "this variable is never reassigned," reducing cognitive load and improving maintainability.|
|semi	|explicit semi-colon usage required. Otherwise the JavaScript engine starts determining where semicolons should be inserted, the feature known as automatic semicolon insertion (ASI). It is considered one of the most controversial features of JavaScript.|

This file is used to instruct ESLint about what rules to check for in your code. Some important rules have been turned off, since they do not work properly in browser-side JS.

**Instructions**  
In this exercise, ESlint is used to analyze code provided for this exercise and to fix possible errors. To run ESLint against the code, first navigate to a folder containing .eslintrc.json, i.e., to the root folder of this exercise.

Our grader uses the same .eslintrc.json as you have in your repository. Exercise fails, if there are any errors in the ESLint report. Warnings do not cause a fail but it is a good practice to fix them still. We recommend that you start using linting in the future.
