## Introduction to EventApp

**General instructions for exercise round 8**

In this exercise round, we'll start with an existing code base of a web application. It is an Express.js app with server-side templating using EJS, session-based user authentication, and tests using Mocha, Chai and Chai-http. Tailwind CSS is used for styles.

You can see the directory structure of the project files below. Most server code is inside app.js, while server.js holds the app.listen() -call. This is done, so that the tests can better maintain the state of the server (npm start starts server.js, while npm test requires only app.js).

As views are rendered using EJS, they are inside the views/ folder, not the public/ folder, in which we only have the little custom css.

```
 
The routes follow the pattern presented in the course material. Further, the routes follow a PRG-pattern (Post-Redirect-Get). That means that if a POSTing of a form results in validation errors, those errors are not shown as a reply to the POST request - a redirect is performed instead and the errors are shown on the GET request. Otherwise, refreshing the browser window would result in duplicate POST. In that process, we need a way to transfer the old input data and the validation errors beck to the form.

**Tests determine success or failure of your code**  
You are provided with hudreds of lines of tests that cover the important features. Right away, the events.test.js and the users.test.js should be passing and cover a majority of the features. Your task is to get the numbered tests to pass. Naturally, you should not edit any of the tests, only the app.js implementation code.

Tests rely on certain things to exists. Often, at least on authenticated user. If you make a mistake in the right (wrong) place, it can cause a lot of tests to turn to red. This is to be expected. Calm down and check your work. It might be, that a very small change brings a lot of them back to green.

The Plussa graders will use same tests to determine if the exercise is completed successfully. Always run tests and fix your code if any of the tests fail before submitting your solution. Failing to do so might make the Plussa grader just timeout without feedback.

Plussa uses its own copy of the same tests. If you run all the tests for an exercise, and they all pass, your will get full points for the exercise.

You can run all tests with npm test or one file at a time with npm test ./test/events.test.js. It is also possible to run individual tests, but sometimes several tests require the same feature (e.g., authentication) to exist.

**Solving exercise 8.2**  
  - Pull the exercise files from the course-upstream: git pull course-upstream main.
  - Go to the exercises/08_authentication directory.
  - Run npm install to get the required packages.
  - Run npm test ./test/events.test.js and npm test ./test/users.test.js to make sure those are green.
  - Run npm start and familiarize yourself with the application. Note, that user registration has not been implemented yet! There are two users in the test_data/users.json file, their passwords are secret1 and secret2 respectively.
  - Familiarize yourself with the application code found in app.js. Make sure you understand at least the following details:
      - The use of PRG-pattern.
      - How validation errors travel from POST routes back to forms.
      - How old form data travels from POST routes back to pre-populate form fields.
      - How bcrypt is used when user logs in. We do not remember what the users password is!
  - When reading throuh the code, also think what parts could help you in completing the next exercises.
  - Familiarize yourself with the tests in test/events.test.js and test/users.test.js. Notice especially:
      - How agents can be used to maintain state between test requests. Without them, we would have to manually send the session cookie in request headers. But using agents forces us to maintain their lifecycle (create AND close).
      - We can test a feature by checking its IO (POST a like and expect a 200 status back), but it is often necessary to also peek under the hood and check if that like got persisted. Typically tests would use some testing database. This would allow us to check if the stuff got added to the database. Curretly, we don't have a database, so we need to expose some server data to the tests.
   

Even though there's nothing to submit from this exercise and hence we cannot give points from completing it, you should still take it seriousely, as there are many concepts here that are valuable to understand.
