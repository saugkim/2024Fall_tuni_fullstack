## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### CSRF

**Exercise instructions**

**Exercise Overview**  
In this exercise, you will work with two server implementations located in the exercises/07_security/ex4 directory. The Good Server, implemented in good_server.js, is developed by you, while the Evil Server, implemented in evil_server.js, is created by a group of no-good villains.

Your Good Server provides a service for transferring money between users but is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. The Evil Server exploits this vulnerability. Your task is to implement a simple CSRF token-based security mechanism to prevent these attacks.

To understand CSRF better, refer to the course material and additional resources such as OWASP's CSRF page and Understanding CSRF.

**Solving the Exercise**

Setting up
Ensure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, specifically in the exercises/ex4 directory.
There are two files in this directory: good_server.js (the Good Server) and evil_server.js (the Evil Server).
The Good Server runs on port 3000 of localhost, while the Evil Server runs on port 3001.
Run both servers in separate terminals using the following commands:
node good_server.js
node evil_server.js
Modify the good_server.js file to implement the CSRF protection based on the TODOs and these instructions.
How the Good Server Functions
Ensure both servers are running.
Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser. You should see a landing page similar to this:
Good Server landing page.

The login credentials for the only user in the system are defined in the users array of good_server.js. Use the username good_user and the password good_pass to log in.
Upon successful login, you should see a page like this:
Good Server successful login.

After logging in, a cookie named secret_for_good_server is set to identify the user. This cookie is used for communication between the browser and the server.
Click the "transferring money" link on the page to navigate to the money transfer page:
Good Server money transfer.

Fill in the "Transfer to" field with any value and the "Sum to transfer (in full Euros)" field with any positive integer. Both fields are mandatory. Click the "Transfer money" button to complete the transfer.
After the transfer, you should see a confirmation page:
Good Server money transfer complete.

You can perform new money transfers without logging in again as long as the cookie exists.
How the Evil Server Functions
Ensure both servers are running.
Navigate to localhost:3001 in your browser. You should see a page like this:
Evil Server.

The Evil Server serves a single page with a link that exploits the CSRF vulnerability in the Good Server. Clicking the link sends a request to the Good Server to transfer money to the evil_user from the logged-in user identified by the cookie.
After clicking the link, you will be redirected to the money transfer page on the Good Server, indicating that money has been transferred to evil_user.
This exercise explicitly shows the CSRF attack for educational purposes. In real scenarios, CSRF attacks can be less obvious.
Browsers send all cookies set by the server with every request by default. This behavior can be modified by setting certain values for the cookie. Refer to MDN's Set-Cookie page for more information.
Your task: Mitigating the CSRF Attack
To mitigate CSRF attacks, add a hidden field to forms with a unique value for each request. This value should be set by the Good Server and be unique to prevent attackers from guessing it.
Save the CSRF token values so they can be checked for each request. Remove the tokens after they have been checked.
Implement the TODOs in the good_server.js file to add this mitigation.
Testing
Ensure both servers are running.
Navigate to localhost:3000 and log in with the provided credentials.
Attempt to transfer money using the Good Server's interface to ensure the CSRF protection works correctly.
Navigate to localhost:3001 and click the link to attempt the CSRF attack. Verify that the attack is prevented by the CSRF protection.
Remember to commit index.js and push the changes to your Git repository before you submit your work in Plussa.
