## Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

### XSS

**Exercise instructions**

**Exercise overview**  
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security exploit which allows an attacker to inject into a website malicious client-side code. This code is executed by the victims and lets the attackers bypass access controls and impersonate users. You can find more information about XSS by reading this MDN page.
  - The MDN page also lists three categories of XSS attacks: stored (also called persistent), reflected (also called non-persistent), or DOM-based.
  - In this exercise you get to write a Node a server with simple defence against reflected XSS attacks. Defence is based on manually escaping user input.
  - NOTE: while usable in this exercise, in larger real-world Web apps manual escaping should not be used. From Google's XSS page: "Writing your own code for escaping input and then properly and consistently applying it is extremely difficult. We do not recommend that you manually escape user-supplied data. Instead, we strongly recommend that you use a templating system or web development framework that provides context-aware auto-escaping."

**Solving the exercise**  
  - Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its exercises/07_security/ex5 directory.
  - Write your code based on the TODOs in the index.js file and the following instructions.
  - You can run your server by running node index.js in this directory, and keep your server running!
  - ALERT! XSS ATTACK INCOMING! The value of the query string parameter addThisText is inserted on to the page without any escaping or encoding. This enables XSS attacks, if query string parameter addThisText includes, for example, code inside script tags.
  - Initially, an XSS attack against the server can be performed just by entering the following text into your browser's address bar and pressing Enter:
```
http://localhost:3000/?addThisText=%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22XSS%20ALERT!!!%22)%3C/script%3E
```
Here, query string parameter addThisText has been used to inject a script on the Web page.

  - After you press Enter and send the request, you will see an alert popup "XSS ALERT!!!". This is just an example which shows that an attacker can inject any script they wish to this site, because the user input has not been sanitized. Your task is to sanitize the user input.
  - You need to encode URL's addThisText query string parameter in a way that any possible scripts or other malicious user input included in it won't run, but all the text user enters as the value for the addThisText query parameter is shown as text on the page in the same place it is now. encodeURIComponent() should be used in this exercise. You should keep this one really, really, REALLY simple.


**Testing**  
  - Trying the above link on the browser's address bar should not pop up the alert anymore.

Remember to commit index.js and push the changes to your Git repository before you submit your work in Plussa.
