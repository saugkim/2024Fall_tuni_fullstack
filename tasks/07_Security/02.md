## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

### Server-side CORS


**Exercise instructions**

**Exercise Overview**  
In this exercise, you will write a server that implements the basics needed for CORS. This includes sending the correct headers with the response to a request sent by a client. You can read more about CORS from the course materials or directly from WHATWG's Fetch Living Standard's section about CORS. https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-cors-protocol

You will implement the server for simple client requests that do NOT require preflight. More details are provided in the following sections.

**Solving the Exercise**  
  - Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its exercises/07_security/ex2 directory.
  - Run your server using the command node index.js in this directory. Keep your server running.
  - Open your browser (Firefox or Chrome) and open a new tab. Open the browser's DevTools and its Console tab.
  - With your server still running, open the index.html file in this directory in the browser. The HTML file contains a script that tries to fetch resources from http://localhost:3000. Due to CORS or CSP not being enabled, fetching will fail. You should see errors in the DevTools Console.
  - Open index.js and complete the TODOs by reading the instructions below.
      - TODO 1: Set the following CORS headers in your server's response:  
              Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Allow access to the server's resources from all origins.  
              Access-Control-Allow-Methods: Allow only the HTTP methods used for simple CORS requests.  
              Access-Control-Max-Age: Allow the CORS information to be cached for four hours (14400 seconds).  
      - TODO 2: Check that the Origin header is set in the client's request. If not, immediately send a response with status code 400 and message body Origin header not in the request. Note: The Origin header is automatically set with Chrome DevTools when using fetch.
      - TODO 3: For requests using either the GET or POST HTTP method, send a response with the CORS headers described above, status code 200, and message body 'I was requested using CORS!'.
      - TODO 4: For client requests using the HEAD HTTP method, send a response with the CORS headers described above and status code 200.
       -TODO 5: If any other HTTP method is used, send a response with status code 405, the CORS headers, and message body "Request used a HTTP method which is not allowed."

        
**Testing**  
  - Inspect the headers, response message bodies, and other properties of the requests and responses in the DevTools Network tab. Access details about a request by double-clicking it.
  - Adding the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header that allows using resources from all origins should eliminate the errors in the DevTools Console when reloading the HTML page in your browser. However, you must define all the headers listed above to receive full points for this exercise.
  - You can test your Node server's responses to different requests by modifying the fetch script in the index.html file and reloading the index.html page in your browser.


Remember to commit index.js and push the changes to your Git repository before you submit your work in Plussa.
