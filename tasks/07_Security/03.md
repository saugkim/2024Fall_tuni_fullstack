## Content Security Policy (CSP)

### CSP

**Exercise instructions**

**Exercise Overview**  
In this exercise, you will practice using Content Security Policy (CSP). CSP is a modern security mechanism implemented in browsers to mitigate XSS threats. It is not a standalone solution but a part of the overall security strategy.

You will write a server with CSP policies for loading images and scripts. Refer to this MDN CSP example for a starting point.


**Solving the Exercise**  
  - Ensure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, specifically in the exercises/ex3 directory.
  - Modify the existing index.js file in this directory to write your server code.
  - Do not edit the other files in the directory:  
         - index.html: Contains img tags for images fetched from Flickr (staticflickr.com) and Creative Commons (creativecommons.org) servers.  
         - js/let_me_run.js: A local JavaScript file that needs to be enabled to run with CSP.  
  - Run your server using the command node index.js in this directory.
  - Keep your server running and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. Initially, you should see the text: "Will we let the script run: NO". Check the browser's DevTools Console for errors similar to:

```
"Refused to load the script 'http://localhost:3000/js/let_me_run.js' because it violates the following
Content Security Policy (CSP) directive: 'default-src 'none''. Note that 'script-src-elem' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback."
```
        
  - Modify the existing Content-Security-Policy header in the index.js file to include the following two CSP policies:
      - Allow retrieving images from the two domains (and their subdomains) used in the index.html:  
            - Flickr (staticflickr.com)  
            - Creative Commons (creativecommons.org)  
      - Use the 'img-src' policy directive to allow fetching images from these domains and their subdomains.
      - Allow the local script file js/let_me_run.js to run. Since this script is hosted on the localhost server, use the 'script-src' policy directive with the 'self' keyword.
      - Define both policies as values for the same Content-Security-Policy header in your server's response. There should be exactly one CSP header in the response.
      - Note: We are not setting the 'default-src' policy in this exercise, but you should do so in the future when using CSP.
      - Example of setting the CSP header with Node.js's writeHead() method:
```
              response.writeHead(200, {
  'Content-Security-Policy': 'style-src *.tuni.fi *.yle.fi; img-src \'self\''
});
```
  - Do not allow images or scripts to be fetched from other origins. Only add the two specified policies.

**Testing**  
When the correct CSP policies are in place, the images will be displayed on the page and the text will change to "Will we let the script run: OH, YES WE SHALL!"

Remember to commit index.js and push the changes to your Git repository before you submit your work in Plussa.
