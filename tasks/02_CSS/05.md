## Responsive web with grids

### Responsive web with CSS grids

**Exercise description**   
Responsiveness is crucial for ensuring that web content adapts seamlessly to different environments, such as devices with varying screen resolutions or when the browser window is resized. In the previous exercise, you implemented CSS for a shop UI. This exercise builds on that by enhancing the CSS to be responsive to screen size without using media queries.

In this exercise, you will make the online shop page responsive to different device screen sizes using CSS grids, specifically:

  - Ensure each column is at least 400px wide.
  - Utilize all available space by maximizing space usage; display as many columns as the viewport width allows.
  - Switch to a single-column layout if the viewport is too narrow for multiple columns.

Instead of relying on grid-area-templates, you should use a combination of grid-template-columns, repeat, auto-fit, and minmax to achieve the desired layout.

Your responsive design should accommodate the following elements in a side-by-side column layout, as permitted by the viewport width:
  - section
  - aside
  - nav

Note that section and aside elements should be placed within the main tag, while >nav elements should be in the footer.
