## HTML with semantic tags

### Using semantic tags and IDs to create a HTML document for the online shop

**Exercise description**

In the exercises in this exercise round you are going to build a general on-line shop UI with HTML and style it with CSS. The UI employs semantic markup, i.e., the new tags introduced in HTML5. Semantic elements define the role of the content to screen readers and search engines more specifically than traditional non-semantic elements.

**Semantic tags - a brief overview**  
When creating the UI you will need to use semantic tags, for more information about semantic tags see https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide/ .

  - header – The <header> element defines content that should be considered the introductory information of a page or section.
  - nav – Main navigation menu links would all be placed in a <nav> tag. But sub navigation menus elsewhere on the page could also get one.
  - main – The body of a page should go in the <main> tag – not sidebars and main navigation. There should be only one per page.
  - article – The <article> element defines self-contained content that could stand independently of the page or site it’s on. For example, a blog post.
  - section – Using <section> is a way of grouping together nearby content of a similar theme. A section tag differs to an article tag because it isn’t necessarily self-contained.
  - aside – An <aside> element defines content that’s less important. It’s often used for sidebars – areas that hold complementary, not vital information.
  - footer – You would use <footer> at the base of a page or section. It might include contact information and some site navigation.

**Implementing this exercise - HTML for an online shop**  
In this exercise, you will implement the structure of a (super-simple and static) online shop with HTML, with focus on utilizing HTML's semantic tags. This exercise is done in anticipation of practising CSS in the next exercise. To emphasize this point: CSS and CSS rules are not a part of this exercise, but the next one.

Implement the exercise in the index.html file you need to create in this exercise's directory exercises/02_css/ex3. index.html must be valid HTML5, you can use validators like one W3C provides to check the validity.

The semantic tags in your index.html file must be as follows:

   - header is the first container element, it contains a nested nav element.
   - Next, comes a main element, it contains an article element inside it. Inside the article element, there are three section elements and two aside elements.
  - footer is the bottommost element under main. This footer contains two nav elements.

The container-containee relationships in your index.html file should be as described above. If there are more than one containees of the same type, using IDs is necessary to identify individual containee elements. IDs must be unique, they make it much easier to select a specific element using CSS selectors e.g. when positioning them. The child elements which require IDs, and the IDs you must give these elements, are described in the table below:

|Parent element|	Child element requiring an ID|	IDs for the elements|
|:--|:--|:--|
|article	|section|	sec1, sec2, and sec3|
|article	|aside|	aside1, aside2|
|footer	|nav|	nav1, nav2|

See Fig.1. for visualization of the structure and layout that can be achieved with these elements. In this exercise only the semantic elements themselves are created. So, you should only observe the hierarchy of the semantic elements (header, nav, ..), not their positioning or their textual contents. The actual positioning of the elements on the displayed page is achieved with CSS grids, which is implemented in the next exercise.

You can open the index.html in your browser, but nothing will be displayed, as there is no visible content in the elements. However, using your browser's DevTools' you can inspect the elements. You can see the DOM tree created from the elements from your browser's Developer Tools, in Elements tab in Chrome and under "Inspector" tab in Firefox.
