## Responsive web with media queries

### Online shop that spans and shrinks with media queries

**Exercise instructions**  
This exercise extends the layout you created in an earlier exercise by making it responsive, but now with media queries, similar to previous exercise, but you know, now with CSS media queries.

The screen widths for different categories of devices you need to handle in this exercise are listed below:

|Device| size | 
|:--|:--|
|Small phone|	< 600px|
|Phone|	600px - 767px|
|Tablet|	768px - 991px|
|Desktop|	992px - 1199px|
|Wide desktop|	>= 1200px|

**Solving the exercise**  
The procedure is the following:

  - Copy index.html and styles.css from exercises/02_css/ex4 to this exercise's directory exercises/02_css/ex6
  - Add responsiveness to styles.css, but now using CSS media queries.
  - You should add your media queries to the bottom of your styles.css file
  - The layouts for the different screen sizes are as follows (the elements IDs remain the same as in previous exercises):
    - if size is small phone, section, aside, and nav elements reside in one column; the order is s1, s2, s3, a1, a2, n1, n2
    - if the size is phone or tablet, elements are set in two columns, the order remains the same, however, nav elements must go to a separate row
    - if size is bigger than tablet, elements are set in three columns. In this situation, the order changes: first row consists of s1, s2, and s3, next row of a1, a2, and an empty space; the last row of n1, n2, and an empty space. Three columns in each row.
  - Empty elements can be put in the middle if needed.
  - Save your style definitions in styles.css.
  - Setting grid-template-areas for each media query can be useful in this exercise, as you have already defined each element with an ID a grid-area earlier.
  - You can set the height on each media query to 100%
  - Commit your changes to git repo
  - Submit your work to Plussa
