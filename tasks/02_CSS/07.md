## Accessible web

### Add ARIA labels

**Exercise instructions**

**AXE - Browser Extension for Accessibility**  
In web development, accessibility plugins are handy in auditing the accessibility of pages. In this exercise, we will be using Axe - an accessibility auditing tool (https://www.deque.com/axe/). It is available as a browser extension for the browsers listed below. Select your desired browser and check the linked page for installation instructions.

  - Chrome
  - Firefox
  - Edge

After installation, the AXE extension can be found in its own tab inside the browser's Developer Tools. (Developer tools can be opened with Ctrl + Shift + I).

Accessibility auditing will be integrated in some of the future exercises.


**Solving the exercise**  
In this directory, exercises/02_css/ex7, there is a file index.html. It shows a bad example of accessibility. Your task is to fix it according to the accessibility rules, e.g., by putting ARIA labels and other labels in place.

Audit the accessibility with Axe, and fix all critical or serious issues that the tool reports. After fixing, check the accessibility once again with the developer tools. When all critical and serious accessibility issues have been fixed, commit your work submit to Plussa.

SIDENOTE: you can optionally explore accessibility with other tools than AXE used in this exercise. For example, in Firefox, you can also use the built-in Accessibility tools that can be found on their own tab inside the Developer Tools.
