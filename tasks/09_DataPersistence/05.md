## Mongoose Schema for event Model

### Mongoose Schema for event Model

**Mongoose Schema for events**

In this exercise you will take the first steps towards integrating a database into the application. The aim is to define Mongoose Schema and Model for the events in the application.

You should start by checking the course material. Further information can also be found at Mongoose Quick Start and Introduction to Mongoose Schemas. Even more information can be found from the Mongoose Documentation

Before continuing make sure you have a mongo database installed and running. Also run npm install to make sure that all the needed libraries are installed, if you did not do that already. You do not need to install any new libraries yourself!

**Schema Description**  
Your task is to complete the schema inside models/Event.js The schema has the following properties:

**_id**  
Automatically created id. DO NOT ADD YOURSELF!

**name**
