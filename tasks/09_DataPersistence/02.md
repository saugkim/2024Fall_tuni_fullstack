## LocalStorage

### LocalStorage

**LocalStorage for client-side data**

  Before continuing, run npm install to make sure that all the needed libraries are installed. You do not need   to install any new libraries yourself!

You can build very performant applications that survive occasional loss of connection with the server as long as you have some method of storing the data on the client itself (and then having some background worker responsible for syncing the changes with the server once a connection is resumed). LocalStorage is one such option. What you store there can be retained even if you close the browser and reboot the computer in between uses.

To learn the basic use of LocalStorage, complete the provided TodoApp so that it stores the needed data in the LocalStorage. Todo app is a good exercise topic as it covers the basics (create, read, update, delete) with minimal UI needs.

**Solving the Exercise**  
Complete the Todo app by fully implementing the incomplete, localStorage realted method stubs.

  - Pull the lates files from course-upstream and navigate to /exercises/09_data_persistence/ex2
  - npm install to get the packages required by the tests.
  - Implement addTask(), getTasks(), saveTasks(tasks), and clearList() in app.js.
      - addTask() needs to get the tasks from getTasks(), add a new task to the tasks with the text of the #taskInput and a done property set to false. It then proceeds to persist the tasks by calling saveTasks(tasks)
      - getTasks() reads the tasks from localStorage. If tasks are found, they are returned as JSON (JSON.parse()), otherwise return an empty array [].
      - saveTasks(tasks) should persist the tasks in localStorage as 'tasks'. Remember to stringify the JSON before setting the localStorage item.
      - clearList() should clear the entire localStorage of any items and re-render the (now empty) tasks list to update the view.
   
        
Before submitted for grading, you can run the test locally with the command:

```
npm test .\test\ex2.test.js
```
