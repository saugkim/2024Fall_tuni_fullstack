## Mongoose Schema for user Model

### Mongoose Schema for user Model

**Mongoose Schema for users**  

In this exercise you will implement the other model, User. While the process is somewhat similar as with the previous exercises Event model, there are a couple of extra points of pain to deal with: password hashing and validating the uniqueness of the email address.

Before continuing make sure you have a mongo database installed and running. Also run npm install to make sure that all the needed libraries are installed, if you did not do that already. You do not need to install any new libraries yourself!

**Schema Description**  
Your task is to complete the schema inside models/User.js The schema has the following properties:

**_id**  
Automatically created id. DO NOT ADD YOURSELF!

**name**  
type: String, 1-50 characters, required. If not present, the validation error message should be exactly Name is required!

**email**  
type: String, required, valid email*, unique. If not present, the validation error message should be exactly Email is required! (*)The User model contains a regex for checking if the email looks like an email. Use that while validating. The validation error message for an invalid email address should be exactly Please fill a valid email address!

**password**  
type: String, required, minimum unencrypted length of 6 characters. If not present, the validation error message should be exactly Password is required!. If not long enough, the validation error message should be exactly: Password needs to be at least 6 characters long!

**role**  
type: String, only accepted values are "admin" and "user", default value "user". For any other roles, the validation error message should be exactly Invalid role!


**Encrypting and comparing passwords**  
Password encryption is done with bcrypt.hash(password, 10), just as last round. Only this time, the hashing will happen in the User model.

There are (at least) two ways to achieve this. One is adding the hashing as pre('save') -hook. Then, you can check if the password property of an existing model instance was changed (using this.isModified('password')) or if this is an entirely new model instance (using this.isNew). If either is truthy, proceed to update the password property to a hashed version before calling next(). Note that using an arrow function will change the lexical scope of this, so either use a traditional function as the callback or prepare to bind the lexical context.

The other option is to define a setter function to the password and encrypt the password automatically when it is set. This will happen even before the save-hook is triggered, but in practice, there's not much difference.


**Enforcing the uniqueness of the email address**  
With Mongoose, you can give validation rules, such as required, minlength and maxlength, min and max, enum, and match. Unique might seem like a validation rule at first sight, but actually it creates a unique index in the database for that field. If this unique index is violated, MongoDB will throw an error (E11000 duplicate key error) instead of ValidationError.

You can intercept this error by adding a callback function to the post('save')-hook. This will accept error, doc, and next. If the error.name is MongoServerError and the error.code is 11000, we know that the unique index was violated and we can turn that into a ValidationError instead. Start by creating a new mongoose.Error.ValidationError() and setting it's errors.email property to new mongoose.Error.ValidatorError (notice the slight difference in those names) with an object containing message: Email is already in use!, path: email, and value: doc.email. Finally, we call the next() with either the validationError or error.

Before submitted for grading, you can run the test locally with the command:
```
npm test .\test\ex6.test.js
```
