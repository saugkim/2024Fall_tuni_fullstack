## Connect URL and its secure handling

### Connect URL set in env variables

**MongoDb Connect URL**

**Keeping the MongoDB Connect safe**  
Before continuing, ensure that you have a mongo database installed and running. If you are using Vagrant from the repository, you should have MongoDB already up and running. In any case, run npm install to make sure that all the needed libraries are installed. You can also run mongodb inside a Docker container, or if you prefer using databases without any client, you might be able to get away with just using `mongodb-memory-server` npm package. You do not need to install any new libraries yourself!  

MongoDB Connect URL needs to be kept in secret. In wrong hands, the data in the database might be tampered with or deleted. Thus, when the URL is stored on a file on your machine, this file must not be saved to the repository, but it must be added to the .gitignore.

In this exercise, we use environment variables to store the MongoDB Connect URL and the express-session packages secret. Environment variables are set in a .env file, that is not supposed to be pushed to any repo. This way, you can have one set of variables for local development, one for tests, and one for production. You just have an .env file present and change the values for each. .env files are common across many languages. (Obviousely, for this particular exercise to work, we break that rule and DO add the .env file to git!) For Node.js, they are read using the dotenv npm package.

**Solving the Exercise**  
Create an .env file in the root of the project /exercises/09_data_persistence/ and add the needed variables there (Yes, the file is simply called ".env", nothing else). The file's format is simple:

```
PARAM=VALUE
```

One variable declaration per line. Set the variable MONGO_URI here, it is used for the Connect URL. Add also the variable SESSION_SECRET, which will be used by the express-session package. Set MONGO_URI variable's value to:
```
mongodb://localhost:27017/events
```

And set SESSION_SECRET variable's value to some random string, that is at least 32 characters long (that is currently concidered a safe length).

Next, you need to be able to read the variables from the environment. dotenv Node module is set as a dependency in the package.json file. This module should be used for managing environment variables from .env file. Examples of setting environment variable file and reading it with dotenv module:

```
  require('dotenv').config();                         // same dir, or
  require('dotenv').config({ path: `${PATH}/.env` }); // in path
```
 
Once variables are set, they are visible in all .js files. The variables can be read with the notation:

```
process.env.PARAM
```

Before grading, you can run the test locally with the command:
```
npm test .\test\ex4.test.js
```
